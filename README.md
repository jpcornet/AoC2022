# AoC2022
ðŸŽ„ AdventOfCode 2022 ðŸŽ„

My first attempts to participate in AoC. Be gentle. Trying as many different languages as possible, one for each day.

* day 1 - SQL

Using PostgreSQL. Need to create the database "aoc2022_1" before running this.

* day 2 - Go

No table lookups...

* day 3 - C

Plain old C, with a dash of apple and gcc specific stuff, to get the timing and for the __builtin_XXX functions to get the rightmost 1 bit in a word.

* day 4 - Bash

Plain bash, no other programs used

* day 5 - Lua

I used lua 5.4, with the "lpeg" and "chronos" luarocks additions installed. lpeg for parsing, chronos just for displaying the time it takes.

* day 6 - perl golf

I consider this different from regular perl. Normally when I write perl I want it to be easy to maintain. This type of perl is write-only and may hurt your eyes when you look at it.

Actually, the language that is used is "perl regexes". It could have been done with pcregrep except perl is easier to actually get the correct output. And the 14-character sequence would have been very tedious in pcregrep.

Wrapped in a shell script to be able to set some perl runtime flags.

* day 7 - Javascript

Using node to turn it into a cli

* day 8 - Python

Python 3.10
