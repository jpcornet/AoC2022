# AoC2022
ðŸŽ„ AdventOfCode 2022 ðŸŽ„

My first attempts to participate in AoC. Be gentle. Trying as many different languages as possible, one for each day.

* day 1 - SQL

Using PostgreSQL. Need to create the database "aoc2022_1" before running this.

* day 2 - Go

No table lookups...

* day 3 - C

Plain old C, with a dash of apple and gcc specific stuff, to get the timing and for the __builtin_XXX functions to get the rightmost 1 bit in a word.

* day 4 - Bash

Plain bash, no other programs used

* day 5 - Lua

I used lua 5.4, with the "lpeg" and "chronos" luarocks additions installed. lpeg for parsing, chronos just for displaying the time it takes.

* day 6 - perl golf

I consider this different from regular perl. Normally when I write perl I want it to be easy to maintain. This type of perl is write-only and may hurt your eyes when you look at it.

Actually, the language that is used is "perl regexes". It could have been done with pcregrep except perl is easier to actually get the correct output. And the 14-character sequence would have been very tedious in pcregrep.

Wrapped in a shell script to be able to set some perl runtime flags.

* day 7 - Javascript

Using node to turn it into a cli

* day 8 - Python

Python 3.10

* day 9 - PHP

Plain old PHP (version 8) without any fancy extensions

* day 10 -  Perl

Plain old perl. No meticulously trimmed grass fields in sight.

* day 11 - Python

Yep, again python. No time to dive into another obscure language

* day 12 - Python

... and again. Adding some OO but that's it.

* day 13 - Python

again. Partly because the data structures could be parsed by python eval().

* day 14 - Go

again. Needed speed.

* day 15 - Go

Needed even more speed.

* day 16 - Go

This took some time to get right... and needed the speed.
